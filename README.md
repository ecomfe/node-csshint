CSSHint is a code review tool based on NodeJS. The current rules are based on ecomfe [CSS STYLE SPEC](https://github.com/ecomfe/spec/blob/master/css-style-guide.md). It also covers [CSSLint](https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint) [rules](https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint/wiki/Rules).

After a period of code refactoring, we finally came to this version, in which `CSS` parser is replaced with [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss).
In addition, we changed the way of implementation which was also able to improve the performance by a large margin. Meanwhile, the following `global` object has three attributes as follows:

- `global.CSSHINT_INVALID_ALL_COUNT`: it is used to count the number of `warn` to serve `max-error`.
- `global.CSSHINT_HEXCOLOR_CASE_FLAG`: it is used to record project's color value, whether the letters are small or capital. `0` is for small and `1` is for capital. This attribute is to serve `unifying-color-case-sensitive`.
- `global.CSSHINT_FONTFAMILY_CASE_FLAG`: it is used to record whether `font-family` is small or capital to serve `unifying-font-family-case-sensitive`.
